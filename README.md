# Vehicular Heatstroke Alerting System

Our IoT solution is to create a system to recognize the presence of children, adults or animals inside the vehicle when the vehicleâ€™s engine is switched off. If this happens for a long interval of time and presence of CO/CO2 increases considerably then the required adults will be alerted first, if no action is taken beyond a threshold time local authority will be alerted.
