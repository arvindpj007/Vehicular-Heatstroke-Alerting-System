# Vehicular Heatstroke Alerting System

## Vehicular heatstroke, hyperthermia. 
The devastating effects of a child being left in a hot car. It's every parent's unfathomable nightmare, yet it happens several times a year. The tragedy can happen almost anywhere, and while hotter months are always the riskiest, the circumstances surrounding child vehicular heatstroke are varied. This is a project that provides a solution to this occurrence.

Our IoT solution is to create a system to recognize the presence of children, adults or animals inside the vehicle when the vehicleâ€™s engine is switched off. If this happens for a long interval of time and presence of CO/CO2 increases considerably then the required adults will be alerted first, if no action is taken beyond a threshold time local authority will be alerted.
